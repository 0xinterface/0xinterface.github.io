Hello there! I'm a software engineer and I love to write about technology, programming, and other things.
I am starting this blog of mine in 2025 amid a period where generated content is taking over the internet as we used to know it.

I feel compelled to write as a human now more than ever given that it will only gets rarer to find genuine writing from humans in the future.

There isn't really a theme to this blog, but I will be writing about things that interest me, and I hope you find joy in reading them.
